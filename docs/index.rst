Greetings! I am Ikram Ali, and I excel at founding and developing machine learning engineering and data science teams.
My current focus areas are **NLP (Natural Language Processing) and MLOps**, where I am passionate about advancing these technologies.


My career strategy involves a deep commitment to mastering the multidisciplinary skills essential for leading data science initiatives.
This includes not only Research and Data Engineering but also Machine Learning Engineering and comprehensive Project Management,
spanning Agile and Product Management techniques. My broad skill set allows me to efficiently lead cross-functional teams and effectively tackle
the challenges of transitioning a model from its initial ideation through to full-scale production.
