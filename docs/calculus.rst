Calculus
=========
Calculus is a branch of mathematics that gives tools to study rate of change
of functions trough two main areas: derivatives and integrals

Derivatives
------------
The derivative of a function is related to its rate of change. The rate of change
tells you how much the output of the function changes when a change is done
to the input. It is calculated as the ratio between a change in the output and
the corresponding change in the input.

You measure the distance traveled (in meters) of a moving train as a function of time (in seconds), as
represented in Figure.

Distance is represented as a function of time. Now, say that you record the speed of the train.

The slope in the left panel corresponds to the rate of change of the function at this point. For instance,
if you take the red slope, you can see that in one unit of time, the distance traveled is 2 meters (for instance,
between  𝑥=0  and  𝑥=1 , you go from  𝑦=−1  to  𝑦=1 ).

Mathematically, the plot in the right figure shows the derivative of the function plotted in the left figure.
The derivative of a function  𝑓  with respect to  𝑥  is the rate of change of  𝑓  as a function of  𝑥.
The derivative of  𝑓  is another function which takes  𝑥  as input and returns the slope of the tangent line of
𝑓  at this value of  𝑥.
